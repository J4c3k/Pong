# Pong
Pong Video Game Clone Created in Unreal Engine 4

## Introduction
Pong is a 2 player video game that simulates tennis.
Players control the in-game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen.
The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent.
Points are earned when one fails to return the ball.

##Opening the project
The project was created using Unreal Engine 3.20.3 and Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
To open the project make sure you have the latest version of Unreal Engine installed and acompanying version of Visual Studio.
Next, open and compile the project.

## Running the game build
To run the game simply double click Pong_Blueprints.exe.

## Details
The game was created using Unreal Engine 4.
The map layout and aspect ratio was created using an image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pong.png
The gameplay mechanics were based off the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiShX2pTz9A
Effort was put in to make the game as close to the original as possible but a couple of changes were made:
1. Paddle movement was smoothed out and inertia was added. That is because original game used dials to control the paddle, not buttons.
2. Player 2 Score was moved closer to the middle of the map so that it would not cover player 2 paddle. That was done to balance the game so that it would not favor player 1.
3. Player Score font is slightly different as the same font was not available and creating a custom font was out of the project scope.

## Requirements
Any modern 64-bit Windows machine should be able to run the game.
The game was developed and internally tested on a PC with following components:
Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Education
Procesor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6600K CPU @ 3.50GHz, 3501 MHz,
RAM: 16GB
Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070
